# TG-NPDCL-Commercial-Electricity-Consumption-Billing-Analysis-Oct-2025-

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard built using government-provided open data from the Telangana Open Data Portal (data.telangana.gov.in).
The dashboard analyzes commercial electricity consumption, billing efficiency, connected load, and regional demand patterns under TG NPDCL.

📌 Project Overview

Electricity distribution systems generate large volumes of operational data that are difficult to interpret using static reports. This project transforms raw commercial electricity data into actionable insights using Power BI, enabling effective analysis and data-driven decision-making.

The dashboard focuses on:

Electricity consumption patterns

Billing performance

Load distribution

Regional and geographical analysis

🗂 Dataset Information

Dataset Name: TG NPDCL Commercial Electricity Consumption Details

Time Period: October 2025

Category: Commercial Consumers

Data Source: Telangana Open Data Portal

Data Provider: Government of Telangana (TG NPDCL)

Format: CSV

Geographical Coverage: Telangana (Circle, Division, Sub-Division, Section, Area)

⚠️ This is official government open data used strictly for academic and analytical purposes.

🎯 Objectives of the Dashboard

Analyze overall electricity consumption and billing performance

Identify areas with the highest connected load

Compare billed vs unbilled services across sections

Study hierarchical consumption patterns (Circle → Area)

Detect high-usage areas using consumption density analysis

Visualize district-wise electricity consumption using maps

📊 Dashboard Features

KPI cards for key performance indicators

Interactive slicers (Circle, Division, Section, Area)

Bar charts, column charts, treemaps, pie charts

Scatter plots for density analysis

Filled map for geographical visualization

DAX measures for advanced calculations

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Power BI Desktop

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

CSV Dataset (Government Open Data)

Data Visualization & Business Intelligence Concepts

🔍 Key Insights

Electricity consumption is unevenly distributed across regions

Certain areas operate under high connected load

Billing efficiency is generally high, with some billing gaps

Consumption density varies significantly across areas

Geographical analysis highlights high-demand districts

🚀 Future Scope

Include multi-month or multi-year data for trend analysis

Apply predictive analytics for demand forecasting

Integrate real-time data updates

Expand analysis to residential and industrial categories

Add anomaly detection and automated alerts
